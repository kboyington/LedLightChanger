# LedLightChanger
Bad python script that can fade into random colors. It was used in a box with one button on the front that would control the lights. 

Please dont use this. It is really bad. It was used to control a kids night light.
When the front button is pressed, it turns all of the lights on. Again, red, then green, then blue, then switches to a random cycling of colors.
